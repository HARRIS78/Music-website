# Music-website

 I created a music site clone using HTML and CSS. The goal was to replicate the design and layout of a popular music website. I focused on ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface with HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling.  While it doesn't have the actual functionality of playing music (as it's a clone), I paid attention to details in terms of design and layout to make it resemble the original site closely.
